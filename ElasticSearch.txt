----------

ElasticSearch can be used both as a search engine and as a data store.
Node:- Every instance of ElasticSearch is called as node.
Cluster:- Several nodes are grouped in a cluster.
Configuration file is "elasticsearch.yml".

There are two important behaviors in an ElasticSearch node, namely the "arbiter" and the "data container".
Arbiter node :- is used to process data and return final response.
Data node :- is used to store data.They contain the indices shards that store the indexed documents as Lucene indices.
             All the standard nodes are both arbiter and data container.

Main data container is called index(plural indices) and it can be considered as a database in the traditional SQL world.In an index, the data is grouped in data types called mappings in ElasticSearch. A mapping describes how the records are composed (called fields)
